    <h1>Welcome to the World of OPC</h1>

    <p>
        In today’s complex economy, information is the key to business success 
        and profitability. OPC technologies were created to allow information 
        to be easily and securely exchanged between diverse platforms from 
        multiple vendors and to allow seamless integration of those platforms 
        without costly, time-consuming software development. 
        This frees engineering resources to do the more important work of running 
        your business. Today, there are more than 4,200 suppliers who have 
        created more than 35,000 different OPC products used in more than 
        17 million applications. The estimate of the savings in engineering 
        resources alone is in the billions of dollars.
